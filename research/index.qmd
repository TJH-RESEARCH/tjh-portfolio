I do applied research in workplaces and communities. My research focuses on understanding factors that impact people's mental health. I draw on organizational psychology, conflict resolution, international affairs, sociology, and other fields.

Currently, I am a Senior Research Associate for the [Center for the Advancement of Military and Emergency Services Research (AMES)](https://www.kennesaw.edu/research/centers-facilities/ames-center/index.php) at [Kennesaw State University](kennesaw.edu).
