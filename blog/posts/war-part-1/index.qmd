This post is first in a series. We are setting out on a journey to explain and predict war using data. 

Why are we doing this? Nothing could be more important than understanding war? If we can explain it, we can act on it. If we can predict it, then we can act in the right place and right time. All this could save countless lives and endless suffering. 

1.  sharing - science in the open refs

2.  Predicting war

3.  \- who am I to do this

4.  —have the INcM background but never specialized in this area

I studied international conflict management, although my research has focued more on psychology and trauma related to conflict and violence rather than war itself. Now, I want to try my hand at studying war, its onset, duration, end, recurrence, and prevention.

1.  —worked on psychology and so am always envious of political science data sets—serve as a basis for research, whereas in psychology measures serve as a basis for research

2.  \- why does it matter: war and peace, moral obligation q

3.  Doing data science + science + business

I am going to start by exploring the data and research on war and peace.

But always with the idea toward the data science end of “production.”

And the scientific end of knowledge

The moral end of understanding a deadly and transformation part of society. 

In doing this, I want to show good data science, good science, and practical business and societal applications of what we learn. 

This first post starts from the very beginning: a brand new project: getting set up with the tools and organization we need: pulling in a data set, and brainstorming some ideas about how to use the data, both by looking at previous research as well as exploring the data itself. 

Exploring 

Both science and data science

States exploratory, then move to production 

# Starting Our Data Project

# Version Control

Set up the repo on github.

Then we can clone the repo to our computer. I do so while in my `data-science` folder where I keep my data projects.

```{zsh}
cd data-science
git clone git@github.com:TJH-RESEARCH/war.git
```

Add a readme file, a .gitignore file, and a license.

The .gitignore file will tell git not to track certain kinds of files. We'll use GitHub's default Python .gitignore file.:

The license

Readme files ... As we go, we will add more detail to explain how the project works and why.

``` md
# War

The goal of this project is to explain and predict war using data.

This is an exploratory project that I expect to evolve. It is inspired by a large amount of publicly available data on war and peace. These include data from [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se).
```

After editing the README, it's time to make the first commit. In general, we want to perform atomic commits. We want to commit each time we make a specific change. We want that change to be one thing that we can summarize in one sentence.

```{zsh}
git add .
git commit -m "Updated README"
git push origin main
```

## Set up a project structure

## Download the Data

There's a few ways to get the data. One simple way is to use `curl` on the command line.

```{zsh}
cd data
curl -o ucp-armed-conflict-25-1.csv https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/ucdpprio/ucdp-prio-acd-251-csv.zipcd
```
