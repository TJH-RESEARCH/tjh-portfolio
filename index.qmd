I am Tommy Hodges, a people analytics expert, combining academic rigour with business acumen.\
\
During my PhD studies, I helped to found the AMES Research Center. We use analytics and research-based programs to improve the workplace wellbeing of veterans, police, firefighters, and medics. In 3 years, we grew to a staff of 20 with a yearly revenue of \$1.9M in contracts and grants. We have trained 1.6K employees and conducted assessments for 38 client organizations and 13.5K personnel.\
\
I wear a lot of hats. I developed our conflict management training program, training over 150 individuals in constructive conflict resolution. I also act as a project manager, data scientist, and consultant. I’ve given 23 public presentations, published 8 articles, and written 3 reports for state agencies.\
\
I’ve had a nonlinear career path. Before my PhD, I worked a few years in HR and Business Development. But I developed a temporary disability, overcame it, then took time to travel, volunteer, intern, and go to grad school. I’ve been driven by learning and growing into a person who can have an impact.\
\
As I transition out of academia, I am looking for roles in Data Science, People Operations, People Analytics, Employee Experience, Engagement, and Change Management at firms that view their people as a strategic investment.\
\
My values are:\
\
🤝 𝐁𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥: I want to work for a company that values transparency, participation, and fairness.\
❤️ 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫: I work best on a team that fosters communication and work-life balance.\
🧑‍🎓 𝐍𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐩 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠: I will thrive at an organization that values learning and curiosity.\
✌️ 𝐃𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠: I want to work for a company that roots its strategy in impact, peace, and sustainability.\
🐕‍🦺 Love dogs: I’m a best friend to 2 Weimaraners.
