title: "About Me"
---

I am Thomas Hodges, a data scientist, research, and expert in people analytics.\
\
During my PhD studies, I helped to found the [AMES Research Center](https://www.kennesaw.edu/research/centers-facilities/ames-center/index.php). We use analytics and research-based programs to improve the workplace well-being of veterans, police, firefighters, and medics. In 3 years, we grew to a staff of 20 with a yearly revenue of \$1.9M in contracts and grants. We have trained 1.6K employees and conducted assessments for 38 client organizations and 13.5K personnel.\
\
I wear a lot of hats. I developed our conflict management training program, training over 150 individuals in constructive conflict resolution. I also act as a project manager, data scientist, and consultant. I’ve given 23 public presentations, published 8 articles, and written 3 reports for state agencies.\
\
I’ve had a nonlinear career path. Before my PhD, I worked a few years in HR and Business Development. But I developed a temporary disability, overcame it, then took time to travel, volunteer, intern, and go to grad school. I’ve been driven by learning and growing into a person who can have an impact.\
