### About me

I am a psychologist, data scientist, and researcher in conflict resolution.

My current research is dedicated to advancing the psychological science and practice of conflict resolution to address interconnected crises facing American communities in the 21st century.

I have a doctoral degree in International Conflict Management — an interdisciplinary study of war, peace, and violence, with an attention to culture and global affairs.

During my PhD studies, I helped to found the [AMES Research Center](https://www.kennesaw.edu/research/centers-facilities/ames-center/index.php). We use analytics and research-based programs to improve the workplace well-being of military veterans, police, firefighters, and medics. In 3 years, we grew to a staff of 20 with a yearly revenue of \$1.9M in contracts and grants. We have trained 1.6K employees and conducted assessments for 38 client organizations and 13.5K personnel.

I wear a lot of hats. I developed our conflict management training program, training over 150 individuals in constructive conflict resolution. I also act as a project manager, data scientist, and consultant. I’ve given [23 public presentations](talks/index.qmd), published [8 articles](research/index.qmd), and written [3 reports for state agencies.](research/index.qmd)\
\
I’ve had a nonlinear [career path.](cv/index.qmd) Before my PhD, I worked a few years in HR and Business Development. But I developed a temporary disability, overcame it, then took time to travel, volunteer, intern, and go to grad school. I’ve been driven by learning and growing into a person who can have a positive impact on the health and well-being of communities.\

My work has been published in Psychology journals such as *Aggression and Violent Behavior*, *Traumatology,* and *Military Psychology,* as well as community-focused journals like the *Journal of Community Engagement and Scholarship* and peace and conflict journals such as *Peace Chronicle.*
