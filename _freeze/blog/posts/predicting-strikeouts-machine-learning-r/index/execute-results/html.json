I'm thinking of the data scientists I meet who sneer when I tell them I use R. Or of Jon Krohn, of the Super Data Science Podcast, a great show, but whose host Jon Krohn make disparaging remarks about R (\"does anyone learn R nowadays?\"). \\[cite\\]\n\nWe are told, with little justification, that Python is better than R for production. That Python is better than R for machine learning. That R is good for statistics, but that's about it.\n\nThese conventional quips are wrong for several reasons. First of all, there is nothing you can do in Python that you cannot do in R, and vice versa. They are both very similar in terms of there capabilities for data science. When new statistics and machine learning techniques are created, they are often made for both languages. When one language gets a new capability first, it is quickly ported to the other.\n\nThese ports can even be identical. Take for example [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), the amazing graphics package for R. It is based on the \"[grammar of graphics](https://ggplot2-book.org)\" which makes plotting intuitively and extensible. In Python there is a nearly one-to-one port called Lets Plot. Lets Plot has the exact syntax as ggplot2. It produces the same plots in the same way.\n\nHere is ggplot2 in R:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here it is in Python using Lets Plot:\n\nThis makes it impossible to say that R is better than Python for graphics, even for someone who believes ggplot2 is the greatest graphics package there is.\n",
