# Summary

A presentation to the [Georgia Injury Prevention Advisory Council (GIPAC)](https://dph.georgia.gov/health-topics/injury-prevention-program/georgia-injury-prevention-advisory-council-gipac): While first responders are at risk for psychological and physical injuries, many of Georgia's first responders we interviewed told us they would not use an available free resource: Employee Assistance Programs (EAP). These interviews suggest a need to reduce stigma of mental health and increase awareness of EAPs.
