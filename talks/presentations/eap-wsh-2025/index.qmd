# Summary

Presentation at the [Work, Stress, and Health 2025 conference](https://sohp-online.org). While EAPs are an available resource to promote behavioral health, many of Georgia's first responders say they will not use them. Concerns include confidentiality and a culture of stoicism and stigma.

# Slides

Coming soon.
