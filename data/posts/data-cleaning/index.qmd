> You analyze the data you have, not the data you want. 

I have conducted over X survey with employees, students, and community members. A common issue with surveys is data quality. 

For this project, I used cutting-edge methods to detect poor-quality survey responses. I then repeated the process for two additional surveys, resulting in clean data sets that have been used for X scientific publications. Additionally, I am drafting a paper that outlines the methods in an accessible way. 

This portfolio post highlights the data problem I faced and the methods I used to over come it.
