    "text": "Abstract\nAs environmental disasters disproportionately affect women, international guidelines to address the disparity focus on the inclusion of women in disaster risk reduction programs. While inclusion is a noble pursuit, it may fall short of equitable outcomes and instead lead to tokenization. Drawing on standpoint feminism and intersectionality, the goal of this study was to investigate tensions between inclusion and equity for women working in disaster risk reduction. We interviewed women from Ecuador and Tajikistan and asked them about the ways that gender shapes their experiences working in disaster risk reduction. We found that the women reflect upon themselves as agents with various forms of privilege and disadvantage, based on their multifaceted identities and differing levels of perceived discrimination within their professions. The findings suggest that inclusion, while necessary, can fall short of its promises. We recommend that organizational guidelines make everyone responsible for fostering equitable workplaces for disaster risk reduction."

Yet, this generation of SSM/Vs faces challenges in higher education, including problems adapting, poor health, and administrative constraints, contributing to worsened academic outcomes and a sense of isolation on campus. This monograph synthesizes research on the challenges facing SSM/Vs. It also frames common aspects of successful programs aiding SSM/Vs as three areas for intervention: how administrators and faculty can create a welcoming campus for SSM/Vs; ways universities can create support systems for SSM/V social, health, and academic success; and engaging community partnerships to enable these efforts. Whether SSM/Vs overcome their challenges and unlock their strengths is contingent on opportunities provided within the school itself, and by its faculty, administrators, students, and community. Central to these efforts should be the goal of inclusivity enhancement, community building, and reduction of health-related dysfunction among SSM/Vs."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAlthough the violence of war is well-known, members of the United States military also struggle with domestic violence, including intimate partner violence and child abuse and neglect. The prevalence of domestic violence is not necessarily higher in the military than in the general population. However, military domestic violence does occur under institutional and cultural conditions quite different from civilian life. Further, service members are at elevated risk for health dysfunctions that can contribute to violence. The current review delineates how domestic violence in the military may be reduced by Alternatives to Violence Project, a widely used, community-based training program in conflict resolution. Specifically, we suggest Alternatives to Violence Project facilitates space to learn interpersonal skills and engage in creative discussions about the stresses and cultural norms that contribute to domestic violence in the military. As Alternatives to Violence Project and similar training does not change the stressors of military life, nor has extensive research documented its impact on violence, additional work is needed. This manuscript represents a first step toward situating conflict resolution in a framework for military domestic violence reduction, showing the potentials and limitations of Alternatives to Violence Project and making recommendations for future research and interventions."

    "text": "Abstract\nVeterans are like migrants, at least according to some military researchers. When service members leave the military, they leave a strong military culture for civilian life, needing to adapt socially, psychologically, and economically to their new life. Confusing this comparison between veterans and migrants; however, is that some veterans are also migrants, born outside their country of military service, raising the question of whether leaving the military is on par with migration as an intercultural transition. Drawing on the example of foreign-born service members, we problematize the notion of “civilian culture.” Then, we reformulate military acculturation theory as military-civilian biculturalism and put forward six questions forming an agenda for future research."

    "text": "Abstract\nHow do military moral injuries affect reintegration? All service members leave the military eventually, but reintegration can be challenging, bringing changes in career, family life, and friendships, potentially prompting a loss of purpose, drive, and connection. Service members may also struggle with a crisis of identity upon separating from the military, feeling their military identity is incompatible with civilian life. While these difficulties are common for service members in reintegration, they may be worsened by moral injury, the adverse biological, social, psychological, and spiritual effects of experiencing an event that deeply offends a person’s sense of right and wrong. People with moral injuries may experience severe inner conflict, guilt, shame, and loss of trust in self, others, and a higher power. These issues may impede reintegration, causing disconnect and alienation in civilian life. Experts believe moral injuries can prompt crises of identity in their own right, which may compound the identity dissonance that commonly follows military separation, although few studies have tried to confirm this belief. In this dissertation, I conceptualize reintegration and identity dissonance, using higher education and family life as examples and drawing on two articles I previously co-authored. I articulate a theoretical framework based on the study of acculturation, the adaptation of people undergoing an international transition. Using evidence from a cross-sectional survey of separated United States service members, I test if moral injury symptoms are associated with reintegration difficulty and to what extent identity dissonance mediates this relationship observed in the sample."

    "text": "About me\nI am Thomas Hodges, a data scientist, research, and expert in people analytics.\n\nDuring my PhD studies, I helped to found the AMES Research Center. We use analytics and research-based programs to improve the workplace well-being of veterans, police, firefighters, and medics. In 3 years, we grew to a staff of 20 with a yearly revenue of $1.9M in contracts and grants. We have trained 1.6K employees and conducted assessments for 38 client organizations and 13.5K personnel.\n\nI wear a lot of hats. I developed our conflict management training program, training over 150 individuals in constructive conflict resolution. I also act as a project manager, data scientist, and consultant. I’ve given 23 public presentations, published 8 articles, and written 3 reports for state agencies.\n\nI’ve had a nonlinear career path. Before my PhD, I worked a few years in HR and Business Development. But I developed a temporary disability, overcame it, then took time to travel, volunteer, intern, and go to grad school. I’ve been driven by learning and growing into a person who can have an impact.\n\n\n\nSite Info\n\nI took inspiration for this site from Andrew Heiss’ excellent website and blog.\nI used Quarto to create the site.\nThe color scheme for the site comes from the Lakota palette in the MetBrewer library for R and Python. The palettes are Inspired by displays at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York."

    "text": "I am Thomas Hodges, a data scientist, research, and expert in people analytics.\n\nDuring my PhD studies, I helped to found the AMES Research Center. We use analytics and research-based programs to improve the workplace well-being of veterans, police, firefighters, and medics. In 3 years, we grew to a staff of 20 with a yearly revenue of $1.9M in contracts and grants. We have trained 1.6K employees and conducted assessments for 38 client organizations and 13.5K personnel.\n\nI wear a lot of hats. I developed our conflict management training program, training over 150 individuals in constructive conflict resolution. I also act as a project manager, data scientist, and consultant. I’ve given 23 public presentations, published 8 articles, and written 3 reports for state agencies.\n\nI’ve had a nonlinear career path. Before my PhD, I worked a few years in HR and Business Development. But I developed a temporary disability, overcame it, then took time to travel, volunteer, intern, and go to grad school. I’ve been driven by learning and growing into a person who can have an impact.\n\n\n\n\nI took inspiration for this site from Andrew Heiss’ excellent website and blog.\nI used Quarto to create the site.\nThe color scheme for the site comes from the Lakota palette in the MetBrewer library for R and Python. The palettes are Inspired by displays at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York."

They make results from employee surveys more accurate and credible.\nPeople Analytics: In real-world settings, testing hypotheses is often less important than quantifying relationships. Bayesian methods is particularly useful for the later.\nHealth and Well-being: We know that mental disorders are bad for people, but just how bad? How do different disorders compare to each other? Comparing the impact of different kinds of trauma can be useful for clinicians and support programs to tailor programs appropriately."

    "section": "Key Highlights",
    "text": "Key Highlights\n\nPrior Predictive Checks\nBayesian methods make use of external information: “the prior.” This external information can help models to “regularize” — give plausible values rather than extreme ones, especially when data is sparse.\nHowever, priors are often criticized (unfairly) as being completely subjective, akin to falsifying data. While that’s a wrong way of looking at priors, you still need to pick good ones and justify them.\n\nSampled from the prior only\nUsed visualizations to assess if priors were reasonable\n\n\n\nZero-Inflated Hurdle Models\nLots of data are “zero-inflated” meaning they have too-many 0s. That makes typical statistical models a poor fit for the data.\n\nvisualizations of distributions\nmodel selection and comparison\ninterpreting results\n\n\n\nInterpreting Complex Models\nBayesian models are fairly easy to understand.\nComplex models such as zero-inflated hurdle models are more difficult to understand.\n\nVisualizing and Summarizing Posterior Predictive Distributions, Marginal Effects"

    "text": "Sometimes you have too many variables. Which ones do you choose? That’s the case with a set of variables from a survey I collected with some veterans. I want to know how veteran identities affects a person’s integration into civilian life. Luckily, there is a validated measure of veterans identity: the “Warrior Identity Scale.” Unluckily, it measures 7 different aspects of military identity, each of which is considered a separate variable.\nThis presented me with the “curse of dimensionality,” having more dimensions to the data than I can easily use. Several options were available. First, I could have used all 7 of the variables. Second, I could have chosen 1 or more of the variables as the most important variables. There are problems with both of these options. Using all the variables leads to a messier model. It has lots of predictor variables — all 7 of the Warrior Identity Scale measures — but it is hard to make sense of how those predictor variables are related. And we should expect some sort of relationship(s). After all, these are all aspects of the same phenomenon, identity.\nThe second option would be to select 1 or more of the identity variables. The problem is this becomes picking and choosing which identity variables matter if it is not done in regards to a particular theory. As research on military identity is still growing, it makes sense to learn from the data about configurations of military identity.\nI used clustering to uncover latent groups of veterans based on their identity.\nThe complete analysis code is available on GitHub. A paper detailing the analysis is currently in the works. I presented a poster based on this work at the Atlanta VA. Below you can find a walkthrough of the data analysis."

    "text": "Real-World Applications\n\nDimension Reduction\nClustering analysis can be used to address the “curse of dimensionality.” It is one tool for “dimensional reduction,” reducing the number of variables you have.\nI used clustering to uncover latent groups of veterans based on their identity. Clustering analysis is an type of unsupervised learning. It finds groups of variables in multiple dimensions. That is, if on a 2 dimensional plot, we could circle apparent groups:\n[image]\nThe same could be done with a 3D plot\n[image]\nWhile we cannot visualize past three dimensions, mathematically we can use the same clustering algorithms in more than three dimensions.\n\n\nData Mining Hidden patterns\nThis approach of learning from the data can be called data mining….Another way of thinking about it is unsupervised learning, a form of machine learning where we use a model to categorize data without having a “true” category to compare the model categorizations to. In other words, there are no “true” configurations of veterans identity that have been named and observed in the data. We are trying to uncover these unlabeled “latent” groupings in the data.\nIn the real world…\nIn this project….\nA key issue with unsupervised learning is not having a ground truth to compare the model. No matter how good it fits the data you have, it is not possible to know if clusters corresponds to real groupings.\nIn the real world….\nIn this project…."

Knowing how to screen poor-quality results can help researchers to use surveys with confidence and report better results to the scientific community. However, while existing guidelines discuss multiple ways to screen data, these guidelines can be difficult to follow, and rarely is guidance given on how to implement screeners. In trying to implement screeners, several practical issues can arise that cast doubt over some existing guidance. The data quality devil is in the details. This tutorial uses an example from the author’s dissertation, along with publicly available R code, to show how to implement data screening measures, particularly on the platform Qualtrics."

    "text": "At the end of their military service, veterans may struggle to adapt to civilian life for a variety of reasons, including traumas experienced during military service. While posttraumatic stress disorder is well known, less is known about how it interacts with the emerging construct of moral injury to affect veterans’ psychosocial functioning. Studies examining the relationship between trauma and functioning have tended to rely on Frequentist data analysis, potentially leading to a focus on testing for the presence of a relationship rather than quantifying the magnitude of the relationship. With the current article, we use Bayesian methods to estimate the effect of posttraumatic stress disorder, moral injury, and their interaction on psychosocial functioning. We draw on survey data from three studies of United States military veterans. The model allows us to quantify a range of probable effects that trauma has on psychosocial functioning."
