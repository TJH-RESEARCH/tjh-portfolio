    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAlthough it is widely accepted among theorists and clinicians that moral injury can affect identity, these claims are rarely specified, let alone investigated empirically. Among scholars of moral injury, an emerging explanation is that moral injury leads to a loss of identity. However, psychologists studying the relationship between identity and trauma argue that some traumatic experiences can reaffirm a person’s identity. Such reaffirmation may lead to a maintenance of identity rather than a loss, helping people make sense of traumatic experiences and be resilient to traumatic stress disorders. Drawing on this model, the Social Identity Model of Identity Change, the current article discusses these two potential processes—identity loss and identity maintenance—in the case of military moral injury. Using data from a survey of United States veterans, it models an indirect association between morally traumatic experiences and moral injury symptoms via military identity. The results indicate that identity is related to moral injury symptoms, although it is unclear if potentially morally injurious events are associated with identity. Moreover, the results depend on how identity is operationalized."

While inclusion is a noble pursuit, it may fall short of equitable outcomes and instead lead to tokenization. Drawing on standpoint feminism and intersectionality, the goal of this study was to investigate tensions between inclusion and equity for women working in disaster risk reduction. We interviewed women from Ecuador and Tajikistan and asked them about the ways that gender shapes their experiences working in disaster risk reduction. We found that the women reflect upon themselves as agents with various forms of privilege and disadvantage, based on their multifaceted identities and differing levels of perceived discrimination within their professions. The findings suggest that inclusion, while necessary, can fall short of its promises. We recommend that organizational guidelines make everyone responsible for fostering equitable workplaces for disaster risk reduction."

Yet, this generation of SSM/Vs faces challenges in higher education, including problems adapting, poor health, and administrative constraints, contributing to worsened academic outcomes and a sense of isolation on campus. This monograph synthesizes research on the challenges facing SSM/Vs. It also frames common aspects of successful programs aiding SSM/Vs as three areas for intervention: how administrators and faculty can create a welcoming campus for SSM/Vs; ways universities can create support systems for SSM/V social, health, and academic success; and engaging community partnerships to enable these efforts. Whether SSM/Vs overcome their challenges and unlock their strengths is contingent on opportunities provided within the school itself, and by its faculty, administrators, students, and community. Central to these efforts should be the goal of inclusivity enhancement, community building, and reduction of health-related dysfunction among SSM/Vs."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAlthough the violence of war is well-known, members of the United States military also struggle with domestic violence, including intimate partner violence and child abuse and neglect. The prevalence of domestic violence is not necessarily higher in the military than in the general population. However, military domestic violence does occur under institutional and cultural conditions quite different from civilian life. Further, service members are at elevated risk for health dysfunctions that can contribute to violence. The current review delineates how domestic violence in the military may be reduced by Alternatives to Violence Project, a widely used, community-based training program in conflict resolution. Specifically, we suggest Alternatives to Violence Project facilitates space to learn interpersonal skills and engage in creative discussions about the stresses and cultural norms that contribute to domestic violence in the military. As Alternatives to Violence Project and similar training does not change the stressors of military life, nor has extensive research documented its impact on violence, additional work is needed. This manuscript represents a first step toward situating conflict resolution in a framework for military domestic violence reduction, showing the potentials and limitations of Alternatives to Violence Project and making recommendations for future research and interventions."

    "text": "Abstract\nVeterans are like migrants, at least according to some military researchers. When service members leave the military, they leave a strong military culture for civilian life, needing to adapt socially, psychologically, and economically to their new life. Confusing this comparison between veterans and migrants; however, is that some veterans are also migrants, born outside their country of military service, raising the question of whether leaving the military is on par with migration as an intercultural transition. Drawing on the example of foreign-born service members, we problematize the notion of “civilian culture.” Then, we reformulate military acculturation theory as military-civilian biculturalism and put forward six questions forming an agenda for future research."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nHow do military moral injuries affect reintegration? All service members leave the military eventually, but reintegration can be challenging, bringing changes in career, family life, and friendships, potentially prompting a loss of purpose, drive, and connection. Service members may also struggle with a crisis of identity upon separating from the military, feeling their military identity is incompatible with civilian life. While these difficulties are common for service members in reintegration, they may be worsened by moral injury, the adverse biological, social, psychological, and spiritual effects of experiencing an event that deeply offends a person’s sense of right and wrong. People with moral injuries may experience severe inner conflict, guilt, shame, and loss of trust in self, others, and a higher power. These issues may impede reintegration, causing disconnect and alienation in civilian life. Experts believe moral injuries can prompt crises of identity in their own right, which may compound the identity dissonance that commonly follows military separation, although few studies have tried to confirm this belief. In this dissertation, I conceptualize reintegration and identity dissonance, using higher education and family life as examples and drawing on two articles I previously co-authored. I articulate a theoretical framework based on the study of acculturation, the adaptation of people undergoing an international transition. Using evidence from a cross-sectional survey of separated United States service members, I test if moral injury symptoms are associated with reintegration difficulty and to what extent identity dissonance mediates this relationship observed in the sample."

I developed our conflict management training program, training over 150 individuals in constructive conflict resolution. I also act as a project manager, data scientist, and consultant. I’ve given 23 public presentations, published 8 articles, and written 3 reports for state agencies.\n\nI’ve had a nonlinear career path. Before my PhD, I worked a few years in HR and Business Development. But I developed a temporary disability, overcame it, then took time to travel, volunteer, intern, and go to grad school.
