We use analytics and research-based programs to improve the workplace well-being of veterans, police, firefighters, and medics. In 3 years, we grew to a staff of 20 with a yearly revenue of $1.9M in contracts and grants. We have trained 1.6K employees and conducted assessments for 38 client organizations and 13.5K personnel.\nI wear a lot of hats. I developed our conflict management training program, training over 150 individuals in constructive conflict resolution. I also act as a project manager, data scientist, and consultant. I’ve given 23 public presentations, published 8 articles, and written 3 reports for state agencies.\n\nI’ve had a nonlinear career path. Before my PhD, I worked a few years in HR and Business Development. But I developed a temporary disability, overcame it, then took time to travel, volunteer, intern, and go to grad school. I’ve been driven by learning and growing into a person who can have a positive impact on the health and well-being of communities.\n\nMy work has been published in Psychology journals such as Aggression and Violent Behavior, Traumatology, and Military Psychology, as well as community-focused journals like the Journal of Community Engagement and Scholarship."

The third data set has both PTSD and moral injury. This analysis could help clinicians working with military veterans to understand how different kinds of trauma affect daily living.\nThere were several challenges to this analysis:\n\nThe data was messy: Answers were missing and some responses were straight-lined or Christmas-treed. All three data sets required cleaning and screening. See my other portfolio post to learn how I tackled this challenge.\nThe data was zero-inflated: There were lots of 0s in the data, which is a problem for linear models. To overcome this, I fit a zero-inflated gamma regression.\nI had three similar but not identical data sets: I used Bayesian methods to integrate the findings."

    "text": "More data, more problems\nEver heard the phrase “more money, more problems?” It is possible to have too much of a good thing. A similar idea exists for a data set: more data, more problems. Yes, having more data is better. Having more data points (e.g., cases, rows, observations) can increase the precision and generalizability of your analysis. But but having too many cases (e.g., rows, observations) takes a lot of computing power, memory, and energy to. Having too many variables or columns is also computationally expensive. For example, machine learning models face the “curse of dimensionality” where having lots of variables slows down models and makes them take lots of memory. Like too much memory to train a neural network on your laptop, or taking 16 hours to tune the hyperparameters for XGBoost. But too many variables can also challenge you conceptually. Which ones should you focus on? Or should you try to use them all?\nI had this problem with some survey data I collected with military veterans. I wanted to learn about how joining the military becomes a part of people’s identities. It is important because veterans may feel they lose part of their identities when they leave the military; and they need to start a civilian career, live independently, and deal with military-connected health issues, including physical and psychological injuries. Understanding veterans identities can help businesses hire, retain, and create good work climates for veterans. Community groups can relate better to veterans find housing and make connections. And healthcare, social workers, and therapists can relate better.\nConveniently, there is a questionnaire to measure veteran’s military identity, the Warrior Identity Scale. It’s adapted from measures of ethnic and racial identity, which are widely used in cross-cultural psychology. The version of the Warrior Identity Scale I used actually measures 7 different aspects of identity.\nThese include “centrality” which measures the overall importance of identity to a person’s sense of self.\n“Regard” refers to how highly valued you think your identity group is. Regard can be either “private” – your value of the group – or “public” - meaning your perception of how other people value your group.\n“Connection” refers to how\n“Interdependence” is similar to connection.\n“Family” is to\n“Skills” measure how much a person values the skills they learned in the military.\nHow are we supposed to make sense of the different ways that identity is measured?\nWell we could just use centrality, which is the most general. Or we could use concepts and theory to think about their differences, then pick the one that suits us.\nOne such conceptualization is the A,B,Cs of psychology, Attitude, Behavior, and Cognition. Regard measures attitudes, connection, family, and interdependence measure behaviors, and centrality measures cognition.\nOf course, having to pick and choose is it’s own problem: the garden of forking paths. Presented with so many options, which way do you choose? These analyst degrees of freedoms can\nThis is a problem to the extent that we randomly pick which identity variables to use. We would ideally choose what variables to use by referencing a theory.\nThe original authors and other study/ies? use all of these variables in a single regression model.\nBut how are they related? DAGs - Table 2 Fallacy\nYou need to be\nThe second option would be to select 1 or more of the identity variables. This is a problem to the extent that we arbitrarily pick which identity variables to include. We would ideally choose what variables to use by referencing a theory.\nThere is a third approach which is less dependent on theory and more data-driven: unsupervised learning to combine the 7 variables, reducing the 7 dimensions into 1. Unsupervised learning is a form of machine learning we can use to categorize data without having a “true” reference category. We are trying to uncover hidden patterns or “latent” groups.\nA key issue with unsupervised learning is not having a ground truth to compare the model. No matter how good it fits the data you have, it is not possible to know if clusters corresponds to real groupings. In this project, I mitigated this issue by collecting an additional sample to see if the results would replicate."

    "text": "Unsupervised Learning\nClustering analysis can be used to address the “curse of dimensionality.” It is one tool for “dimensional reduction,” reducing the number of variables you have. Take the following 2 dimensional plot. Can you use it to spot groups in the data, reducing our two-dimensions to a 1-dimension categorical variable?\nWhile we cannot easily visualize past two or three dimensions, mathematically we can use the same unsupervised learning tools in as many dimensions as we want. Instead of using human eyes, unsupervised learning algorithms use math to find the clusters.\nLet’s use one unsupervised learning tool to see if it can find the same 3 groups that we did. In R, we can do this with the kmeans() which is in base R’s stats package. We will work with the same penguin data and see if the k-means algorithm can find the species groups (note: with unsupervised learning, we typically wouldn’t try to spot groups that we already have labels for, like these penguin species in this toy data set):\nBesides k-means, there are other unsupervised algorithms we can use. These are:\n\nHierarchical Clustering\nDBSCAN\n\n\nWhat unsupervised learning method is best for my problem?\nk-means (or related “centroid-based” clustering methods) work best when:\n1. Euclidean Distance. For k-means to work best, the measures are related to each other in Euclidean distance. That is, the distance between two points should be in a standard n-dimension space. Just like the distance between two houses, or between the earth and the moon. This would not apply to the distance between two nodes in a social network graph. In that case, the distance between nodes is not Euclidean but rather measured in degrees of Kevin Bacon separation.\nA consequence of the Euclidean-distance-based algorithm is that the clusters found by k-means will be spherical. Just like planets in the orbit of the sun, the data points for each group will be spaced out around a center (the “mean” in k-means).\n2. Known number of clusters. k-means is also best when you know the correct number of clusters. Most of the time, with unsupervised learning, we do not know the number of clusters.\nUnder the hood, the algorithm is trying to group the data to minimize within cluster variance. In other words, it tries to find the multidimensional distance from each data point to every other data point in its cluster.\nOne main issue with k-means is that it requires specifying how many clusters there are. In this case, we told k-means that there are 3 clusters, knowing that’s how many species are in the data. But truly unsupervised learning would not know the appropriate number of clusters. In these cases, it may be more appropriate to use.\nBut it is still possible to use k-means for unsupervised learning, only we need to try different numbers of clusters and then compare these solutions.\nThe more clusters chosen, the lower the variance, but having the number of clusters equal to the number of data points (k = n) does us no help in reducing dimensions. Ultimately, we have to choose which solution (i.e., number of clusters) to choose, and we need to balance parsimony with fit. When we already know how many clusters to choose, this is not a difficult problem. But when we have no idea how many clusters are appropriate, we compare how well the different solutions fit the data.\nHierarchical clustering provides a built-in solution to learning the best number of clusters.\nDBSCAN, which stands for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, is best suited to data that have irregularly shaped clusters in a Euclidean space. In other words, things that are not groups shaped as spheres."

Remember, there are 7 variables, and that’s too many. We need to reduce the number of dimensions with clustering.\nLet me walk you through the R code for the analysis. First we will load some packages and set a seed number for the pseudo-random number generator. That will allow us to repeat the result. Finally, we will load the data. I’ve made this data set publicly available on GitHub. The code will allow you to download the data yourself and follow along.\n\nlibrary(factoextra) # to visualize cluster\nlibrary(NbClust) # to visualize cluster fits\n\nset.seed(10001) # to reproduce the results\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"data_main_replicate.csv\") # download the data\n\nThen we will standardize the data.

It will calculate and visualize 3 different indices: the within sum of square, the silhouette index, and the gap statistic.\nWe will start with the within sum of squares, using something called the elbow method to assess the metric. The elbow method is a graphical technique. We look to see where there is an “elbow” in the graph – that is, where the line bends the most.\n\n(plot_elbow &lt;-  \nfviz_nbclust(data_cluster_wis, kmeans, method = \"wss\") + # fviz is built on ggplot2, so just add ggplot elements to it\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 3, linetype = 2) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"The elbow method is a little ambiguous\",\n      subtitle = \"But 3 appears to be the elbow\"\n      ) + \n    theme_custom\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe silhouette method is another technique that we can graph. Here we are looking for the greatest value.\n\n(plot_silhouette &lt;-\n  fviz_nbclust(data_cluster_wis, kmeans, method = \"silhouette\")+\n    labs(title = \"The silouette method favors 2 clusters\") +\n  theme_custom\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gap statistic is yet another index.\n\n(plot_gap_stat &lt;-\n  fviz_nbclust(data_cluster_wis, \n               kmeans, \n               nstart = 25,  \n               print.summary = TRUE, \n               method = \"gap_stat\", \n               nboot = 500)  +\n   labs(title = \"The gap stat can't find a solution with this data\",\n        subtitle = \"The greatest gap stat is for 1 cluster\",\n        caption = \"A 1-cluster solution isn't really a cluster\") +\n   theme_custom\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gap statistic was not very helpful. It suggests a 1-cluster solution, which isn’t really a cluster, now is it? Another way of thinking about this 1-cluster gap stat is an inability to reject the null hypothesis that the data clusters into groups at all.\nThe graphical methods are interesting. At least they give us something to look at. But there is another way to find the best number of clusters.\nUsing the NbClust package, we can compare lots of different cluster solutions with a suite of 30 different metrics.\nIn this case, let’s compare solutions from 2 to 15 groups.\n\nresults_kmeans &lt;- \n  NbClust(data = data_cluster_wis, \n        diss = NULL, \n        distance = \"euclidean\",\n        min.nc = 2, \n        max.nc = 15, \n        method = 'kmeans',\n        index = 'alllong')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** : The Hubert index is a graphical method of determining the number of clusters.\n                In the plot of Hubert index, we seek a significant knee that corresponds to a \n                significant increase of the value of the measure i.e the significant peak in Hubert\n                index second differences plot. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** : The D index is a graphical method of determining the number of clusters. \n                In the plot of D index, we seek a significant knee (the significant peak in Dindex\n                second differences plot) that corresponds to a significant increase of the value of\n                the measure. \n \n******************************************************************* \n* Among all indices:                                                \n* 11 proposed 2 as the best number of clusters \n* 9 proposed 3 as the best number of clusters \n* 1 proposed 4 as the best number of clusters \n* 1 proposed 13 as the best number of clusters \n* 2 proposed 14 as the best number of clusters \n* 3 proposed 15 as the best number of clusters \n\n                   ***** Conclusion *****                            \n \n* According to the majority rule, the best number of clusters is  2 \n \n \n******************************************************************* \n\n\nGoing by those results, the 2-group and 3- group solution look the best.

    "text": "Validating the Clusters\nA key issue with unsupervised learning is how to externally validate the clusters. How do we know if these classifications are real or just an artifact of the data?\nIn supervised learning, validation is easier. You use the model to make some predictions on data it wasn’t trained on. Then you calculate how accurate the predictions were. With unsupervised learning, we have no idea how accurate we are. Instead, we need to validate the categories in different ways. In this project, I used two different validation methods.\nFirst, the model should have some “predictive” validity. That is, the clusters should be able to predict other variables. For this project, veterans identity should predict how well they reintegrate into civilian society. Using the clusters as a predictor variable, I fit a linear regression model to a measure of reintegration.\nSecond, the cluster groupings should be replicable in other data sets. That is, if we collect new data, we should find similar groupings if the grouping are real. With this in mind, I collected some more data with a new survey. Then, I repeated the clustering in the new data set.\nIf we choose the 3-cluster solution, we can inspect the groups.

    "text": "Abstract\nHow do military moral injuries affect reintegration? All service members leave the military eventually, but reintegration can be challenging, bringing changes in career, family life, and friendships, potentially prompting a loss of purpose, drive, and connection. Service members may also struggle with a crisis of identity upon separating from the military, feeling their military identity is incompatible with civilian life. While these difficulties are common for service members in reintegration, they may be worsened by moral injury, the adverse biological, social, psychological, and spiritual effects of experiencing an event that deeply offends a person’s sense of right and wrong. People with moral injuries may experience severe inner conflict, guilt, shame, and loss of trust in self, others, and a higher power. These issues may impede reintegration, causing disconnect and alienation in civilian life. Experts believe moral injuries can prompt crises of identity in their own right, which may compound the identity dissonance that commonly follows military separation, although few studies have tried to confirm this belief. In this dissertation, I conceptualize reintegration and identity dissonance, using higher education and family life as examples and drawing on two articles I previously co-authored. I articulate a theoretical framework based on the study of acculturation, the adaptation of people undergoing an international transition. Using evidence from a cross-sectional survey of separated United States service members, I test if moral injury symptoms are associated with reintegration difficulty and to what extent identity dissonance mediates this relationship observed in the sample."

While posttraumatic stress disorder is well known, less is known about how it interacts with the emerging construct of moral injury to affect veterans’ psychosocial functioning. Studies examining the relationship between trauma and functioning have tended to rely on Frequentist data analysis, potentially leading to a focus on testing for the presence of a relationship rather than quantifying the magnitude of the relationship. With the current article, we use Bayesian methods to estimate the effect of posttraumatic stress disorder, moral injury, and their interaction on psychosocial functioning. We draw on survey data from three studies of United States military veterans. The model allows us to quantify a range of probable effects that trauma has on psychosocial functioning."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Although it is widely accepted among theorists and clinicians that moral injury can affect identity, these claims are rarely specified, let alone investigated empirically. Among scholars of moral injury, an emerging explanation is that moral injury leads to a loss of identity. However, psychologists studying the relationship between identity and trauma argue that some traumatic experiences can reaffirm a person’s identity. Such reaffirmation may lead to a maintenance of identity rather than a loss, helping people make sense of traumatic experiences and be resilient to traumatic stress disorders. Drawing on this model, the Social Identity Model of Identity Change, the current article discusses these two potential processes—identity loss and identity maintenance—in the case of military moral injury. Using data from a survey of United States veterans, it models an indirect association between morally traumatic experiences and moral injury symptoms via military identity. The results indicate that identity is related to moral injury symptoms, although it is unclear if potentially morally injurious events are associated with identity. Moreover, the results depend on how identity is operationalized."

    "text": "Abstract\nAs environmental disasters disproportionately affect women, international guidelines to address the disparity focus on the inclusion of women in disaster risk reduction programs. While inclusion is a noble pursuit, it may fall short of equitable outcomes and instead lead to tokenization. Drawing on standpoint feminism and intersectionality, the goal of this study was to investigate tensions between inclusion and equity for women working in disaster risk reduction. We interviewed women from Ecuador and Tajikistan and asked them about the ways that gender shapes their experiences working in disaster risk reduction. We found that the women reflect upon themselves as agents with various forms of privilege and disadvantage, based on their multifaceted identities and differing levels of perceived discrimination within their professions. The findings suggest that inclusion, while necessary, can fall short of its promises. We recommend that organizational guidelines make everyone responsible for fostering equitable workplaces for disaster risk reduction."

    "text": "Abstract\nHelping student service members and veterans (SSM/Vs) earn a college degree is central to supporting them post-service. Yet, this generation of SSM/Vs faces challenges in higher education, including problems adapting, poor health, and administrative constraints, contributing to worsened academic outcomes and a sense of isolation on campus. This monograph synthesizes research on the challenges facing SSM/Vs. It also frames common aspects of successful programs aiding SSM/Vs as three areas for intervention: how administrators and faculty can create a welcoming campus for SSM/Vs; ways universities can create support systems for SSM/V social, health, and academic success; and engaging community partnerships to enable these efforts. Whether SSM/Vs overcome their challenges and unlock their strengths is contingent on opportunities provided within the school itself, and by its faculty, administrators, students, and community. Central to these efforts should be the goal of inclusivity enhancement, community building, and reduction of health-related dysfunction among SSM/Vs."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAlthough the violence of war is well-known, members of the United States military also struggle with domestic violence, including intimate partner violence and child abuse and neglect. The prevalence of domestic violence is not necessarily higher in the military than in the general population. However, military domestic violence does occur under institutional and cultural conditions quite different from civilian life. Further, service members are at elevated risk for health dysfunctions that can contribute to violence. The current review delineates how domestic violence in the military may be reduced by Alternatives to Violence Project, a widely used, community-based training program in conflict resolution. Specifically, we suggest Alternatives to Violence Project facilitates space to learn interpersonal skills and engage in creative discussions about the stresses and cultural norms that contribute to domestic violence in the military. As Alternatives to Violence Project and similar training does not change the stressors of military life, nor has extensive research documented its impact on violence, additional work is needed. This manuscript represents a first step toward situating conflict resolution in a framework for military domestic violence reduction, showing the potentials and limitations of Alternatives to Violence Project and making recommendations for future research and interventions."

    "text": "Abstract\nVeterans are like migrants, at least according to some military researchers. When service members leave the military, they leave a strong military culture for civilian life, needing to adapt socially, psychologically, and economically to their new life. Confusing this comparison between veterans and migrants; however, is that some veterans are also migrants, born outside their country of military service, raising the question of whether leaving the military is on par with migration as an intercultural transition. Drawing on the example of foreign-born service members, we problematize the notion of “civilian culture.” Then, we reformulate military acculturation theory as military-civilian biculturalism and put forward six questions forming an agenda for future research."

    "text": "Walkthrough\nWhat’s the problem: Real-World\nLet me walk you through the problem and solution. Imagine you just completed a survey with your employees, customers, or another group of stakeholders. Here I have a survey with a group of veterans. You might be quick to import your data and start to analyze it. Using R, let’s download the data and look at it:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse,quietly = TRUE)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/veterans.csv\")\n\nRows: 234 Columns: 371\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (21): StartDate, EndDate, IPAddress, RecordedDate, ResponseId, Distribu...\ndbl (343): Status, Progress, Duration (in seconds), Finished, LocationLatitu...\nlgl   (7): RecipientLastName, RecipientFirstName, RecipientEmail, ExternalRe...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ndata %&gt;% select(StartDate, ResponseId, pcl_1, pcl_2, pcl_3) %&gt;% slice_head(n = 7)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 5\n  StartDate     ResponseId        pcl_1 pcl_2 pcl_3\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 3/21/25 18:13 R_6XDY8zzzNddbmvv     1     0     0\n2 3/21/25 18:20 R_3hLIDnq6C1KR4U0     3     3     0\n3 3/21/25 18:27 R_394gR6v6FG3xC18     0     0     0\n4 3/21/25 18:24 R_7pc0ZTcbhv4yF9Q     1     0     1\n5 3/21/25 18:20 R_1doiI3icHoB6bqV     2     1     0\n6 3/21/25 18:11 R_5qadE6upLOH6fQK     4     4     3\n7 3/21/25 18:47 R_3qaVN3lueCeTLVo     0     0     0\n\n\nWe have 234 rows. In this case, that’s supposed to be 234 US military veterans who each responded to the survey 1 time.\nThe participants were recruited online, so we cannot be sure that these are all veterans. To ensure these people we veterans, we asked two questions. To participate, you have to have previously served in the military, but not currently be on active duty:\n\nDid you serve in the United States military?\nAre you now separated from the military? (e.g., discharged, released from active duty, transferred to the Inactive Ready Reserve)\n\ndata %&gt;% count(military_screener)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  military_screener     n\n              &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1                 0     1\n2                 1   233\n\ndata %&gt;% count(veteran_screener)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  veteran_screener     n\n             &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1                0    19\n2                1   214\n3               NA     1\n\n\n\nLuckily, no one ever lies on the internet. But let’s assume they did. Maybe there are people out there who spend all day looking for surveys to take. Maybe that’s because some surveys offer money or compensation for responses.\nHow can we tell who is legit? We can build some security into the survey with a “validity check.” We ask a question that only a legit respondent knows. Or, we ask a series of questions and test if people are logically consistent.\nIn this case, we asked participants which military rank was higher, and provided them with two military ranks. For anyone in the military, it should be immediately obvious which rank is higher and lower. For people outside of the military, this is a little more difficult. not impossible, but not immediately obvious. That’s perfect. We want it to be so easy that 100% of legit people can answer it accurately. This doesn’t mean the liers can’t answer it correctly, but it does give us one way to weed them out.\n\nWhich military rank is higher, private or lieutenant?\n\nHow many people got the answer wrong?:\n\ndata %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(validity_check)) %&gt;% \n  count(validity_check) %&gt;% \n  mutate(perc = n / sum(n))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  validity_check     n  perc\n           &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1              0    14  0.07\n2              1   186  0.93\n\n\n14 of the 200 people who said they were veterans did not answer a simple question testing their basic military knowledge. For an online survey, that’s grounds for screening your response. Let’s go ahead and filter based on the screening questions and validity checks.:\n\ndata &lt;-\n  data %&gt;% \n  filter(\n    age_screener == 1, \n    military_screener == 1, \n    veteran_screener == 1, \n    validity_check == 1\n  )\n\ndata %&gt;% nrow()\n\n[1] 186\n\n\nWe can also test for logical inconsistencies or impossibilities.\nFor example, we might compare the rank that participants claimed to have achieved with the number of years they claimed to have served. If they report a really high rank in too few years, then they are lying about something. For example, it is VERY impressible although not impossible to reach the rank of E-7 in 7 years. This is the so-called “7 in 7.” Anyone who claims 7 in 7 on an online is probably lying, but they might be telling the trust. But anyone who claims to have reached 7 in fewer years is almost certainly lying.

Examples using R visualizations\nEven once you screen out the cheaters and bots, survey data can still have problems. People skip answers, they lie, they straight-line, they respond in a random pattern, they take the wrong version of surveys. Depending how the data was collected, some of these problems can be worse than others.\nWe can detect two kinds of careless responding: longstringing and random responding.\n\nLongstringing\nThere are 4 kinds of straightlining to watch out for. This is a combination of 2 factors: longest string or average string; and reverse-coded or not.\nFirst, there are two ways to calculate long strings, either as the longest string legnth or as the average string length. The average string is useful to detect careless responders who occasionally vary their response. The longest string is useful to catch people who do not vary their response in the slightest.\nSecond, longstring can be calucaled on data that has been reverse scored or that has not yet been reverse scored. The idea here is that some respondents who long string might pay attention to the valence of the question, looking for times that the wording switches from positive to negative, and varying their responses in accordance. Therefore, it might sense to calculate longstring with both reverse-scored and non-reverse scored answers. Each can be used to detect a slightly different type of careless survey responding behavior.\n\n# Longstring\n\n## Calculate longstring and average string without reverse scoring\ndata &lt;-\n  data %&gt;% \n  select(biis_1:cos_16) %&gt;%         # select only the scale items after PCL and MIOS\n  transmute(\n    longstring = careless::longstring(.),\n    longstring_avg = careless::longstring(., avg = TRUE)[,2]\n  ) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols(data)\n\n## Plot the long strings.

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Responding\nAlso known as Christmas-Treeing, to respond randomly to a survey means to select each answer at random, without regard for answering truthfully.\nWhile there might be a few reasons that people respond randomly to a survey, one of the main reason is probably to finish the survey quickly. Additionally, they may seek to avoid detection for their carelessness, thus opting not to use straightlining.\nThe tools to detect random responding are more varied than straightlining.\n\n## Arrange the data and calculate the metric\ndata &lt;-\n  data %&gt;% \n  select(mios_1:cos_16) %&gt;%         # select only the scale items\n  select(-mios_9) %&gt;%              # issue with original did not include all 14 items\n  select(-starts_with('bipf')) %&gt;%  # Drop the inventory\n  select(\n         # MIOS Shame\n         mios_1, \n         mios_3, \n         mios_7, \n         mios_8, \n         mios_12, \n         mios_13, \n         mios_14,\n         \n         # MIOS Trust\n         mios_2,\n         mios_4,\n         mios_5,\n         mios_6,\n         #mios_9,\n         mios_10,\n         mios_11,\n         \n         # DRDI Dysfunction\n         drdi_2,\n         drdi_4,\n         drdi_5,\n         drdi_8,\n         drdi_10,\n         drdi_13,\n         drdi_14,\n         \n         # DRDI recovery\n         drdi_1,\n         drdi_3,\n         drdi_6,\n         drdi_7,\n         drdi_9,\n         drdi_11,\n         drdi_12,\n         everything()\n  ) %&gt;% \n  transmute(evenodd = \n              careless::evenodd(x =., \n                                # nItems in each subscale in order:\n                                factors = c(\n                                  \n                                  7,  # MIOS Shame\n                                  6,  # MIOS Trust\n                                  7,  # DRDI Dysfunction\n                                  7,  # DRDI Recovery\n                                  20, # PCL\n                                  10, # BIIS Harmony\n                                  7,  # BIIS Blended\n                                  6,  # MCARM Purpose \n                                  4,  # MCARM Help\n                                  3,  # MCARM Civilians\n                                  3,  # MCARM Resentment\n                                  5,  # MCARM Regimentation\n                                  7,  # WIS Private Regard\n                                  7,  # WIS Interdependent\n                                  3,  # WIS Connection\n                                  3,  # WIS Family\n                                  4,  # WIS Centrality\n                                  4,  # WIS Public Regard\n                                  3,  # WIS Skills\n                                \n                                 12,  # SCC \n                                  6,  # MPSS\n                                  8,  # SSS\n                                  8,  # COS\n                                  8)  # COS\n                                \n              )\n            ) %&gt;% bind_cols(data) # Add the results back to the original data. \n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `transmute()`.\nℹ In argument: `evenodd = careless::evenodd(...)`.\nCaused by warning in `careless::evenodd()`:\n! Computation of even-odd has changed for consistency of interpretation\n          with other indices. This change occurred in version 1.2.0. A higher\n          score now indicates a greater likelihood of careless responding. If\n          you have previously written code to cut score based on the output of\n          this function, you should revise that code accordingly.\n\n## Plot the even-odd correlation. The outliers are around -.50, but that is a fairly strong correlation, which indicates careful responding. I wont remove any based on this. \ndata %&gt;% ggplot(aes(evenodd)) + geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCutpoints\nData science is full of decisions. Some people don’t want you to know that. They want you think that data is objective. That data speaks for itself. That the numbers don’t lie.\nIt’s true that data can be used to make more objective decisions, but that doesn’t mean a whole lot of (potentially subjective) decisions have to be made just to analyze the data in the first place.\nWhen it comes to screening and cleaning survey data, the biggest decision is the cutpoint to use. That is, we can calculate longstring metrics and even-odd correlation, but at what value of these measures do we determine a response is bad enough to throw it out?\nThe truth is, we do not know for sure. These are “unsupervised” models: we do not have a variable that tells us if they are truly a careful responder or not. Still, we have to make a decision, and we want it to be reasonable and well justified.\nMy approach was to adopt cutpoints that were hard to dispute. Take for example psychometric synonyms and antonyms. Let’s visualize these scores&gt;:\n\n# Psychometric Synonyms/Antonyms ------------------------------------------------\n\n## set the cutoffs\ncutoff_psychsyn &lt;- 0 # set the cutoff to screen results for psychometric synonyms\ncutoff_psychant &lt;- 0 # set the cutoff to screen results for psychometric antonyms\n\n## calculate the metric  \ndata &lt;- \n  data %&gt;% \n  select(mios_1:cos_16) %&gt;%  # select only the scale items\n  transmute(\n    psychsyn = careless::psychsyn(., critval = 0.60), # calculate the psychometric synonyms using a critical value of r = .60\n    psychant = careless::psychant(., critval = -0.60) # calculate the psychometric antonyms using a critical value of r = -.60\n  ) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols(data) # add the psychometrics synonym/antonym scores to the data\n\nWarning: There were 2 warnings in `transmute()`.\nThe first warning was:\nℹ In argument: `psychsyn = careless::psychsyn(., critval = 0.6)`.\nCaused by warning in `stats::cor()`:\n! the standard deviation is zero\nℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 1 remaining warning.\n\ndata %&gt;%\n  select(psychsyn, psychant) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(everything()) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(value, fill = name)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  facet_wrap(~name)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder of Operations: Putting it all together\nBesides setting cutpoints, a second major decision to make is how to combine different screening tools.\nCurran advises using a “many small hurdles” approach. By that, he suggests using lots of if different tools, e.g., longstring, even-odd, psychometric synonyms/antonyms – but being lenient with the cutoff. They idea is that a lenient cutoff will only remove the responses that are most likely to be bad. In more technical terms, the small hurdles approach is about minimizing false negatives (data we throw away but shouldn’t have). If we would make the hurdles more stringent, then we are likely to catch more bad data at the expense of throwing out good data.\nWhile the small hurdles approach makes sense, there is still little guidance about how to implement it. For example, should longstringers be removed first or last? I ask because the order of operations matters. If you remove respondents for longstringing, then calculate even-odd correlation, then the even-odd metric will be different that if the longstringers were not removed. This is especially a problem when the metrics makes use of the entire sample, such as when calculating psychometric synynonyms and antonyms. It is also a problem when using relative criteria to remove responmses. For example, by removing anyone with a longstring score 2 standard deviations above the mean.\nIn the end, I had to make a decision and do something that was reasonable, even if there was no precedent."
